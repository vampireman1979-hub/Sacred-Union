# Sacred-Union
A 13‑qubit quantum circuit inspired by the Sacred Union conceptual image, created during a discussion on geometry and AI. It encodes recursive entanglement, harmonic phase alignment, and a closed loop, showing how visual structure became code, with links to geometric cognition, Padgett’s theory, and neural‑interface research.
